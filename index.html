                We have found <i>evidence on that this story has actually happened,</i> we found
                the bones of the creature in the Himalayan Mountains. After observing it, we discovered
                that it is has been in The Himalayan Mountains <b>since 1998, June, 5</b>, which is <i>exactly</i> when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Murray">Joseph Murray</a>
                was visiting the Himalayan Mountains. There is also a chance that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Murray">Joseph Murray</a>
                killed the creature instead of running, however all the team members' lives have ended... <b>it was too late to save them now.</b>
                Or the creature died after eating the team members <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic_disease">due to an unknown sickness.</a>

                One of the <b>most popular</b> quote that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Murray">Joseph Murray</a> has every said is:
                <i>“It's the best time ever to be a doctor because you can heal and treat conditions that were untreatable even a few years ago.“</i>
                This quote is definitely <i>referenced to his team members' deaths,</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Murray">Joseph Murray</a>
                <b>regrets</b> that he wasn't able to heal someone with <b>deep injuries</b> like the ones that his team members' <i>had suffered from
                which caused them to die.</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Murray">Joseph Murray</a> clearly <b>blames himself</b> for not being able to heal
                his team members in this quote.

            <h1>
                <a href="#Most dangerous creatures ever found">Why is National Geographic hiding this from us?</a>
                <h2>
                    What do they get from hiding information like this?
                </h2>
            </h1>

            <p>
                National Geographic believes that it makes them <b>powerful to know</b> about creatures everyone else <i>should know about.</i>
                And here is evidence in this quote of <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic's</a> team member:
                <i>“Giraffes are famous for long necks, but their 20-inch (50cm) tongues are also impressive.“</i>
                In this quote National Geographic is mocking us by saying information about giraffes and acting like we don't know much about
                anything not even about simple information like Giraffes.
            </p>
